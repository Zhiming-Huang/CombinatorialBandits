# Combinatorial bandit algorithms

This repository is the implementation of combinatorial bandit algorithms. Currently, only stochastic bandit algorithms are implemented and more algorithms are to be added.

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Structure
The source code of simulator and various algorithms can be found in src/
The experiment script can be found in tests/
The Results can be found in tests/results/

## Evaluation
Currently, we provide two tests, which can be found in tests.
